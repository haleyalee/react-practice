The Message component contains an anchor element and a paragraph below the anchor. Rendering of the paragraph should be toggled by clicking on the anchor element using the following logic:

* at the start, the paragraph should not be rendered
* after a click, the paragraph should be rendered
* after another click, the paragraph should not be rendered
