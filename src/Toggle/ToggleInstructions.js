      <p>
        We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to modify the component so 
        that you can properly toggle the button to switch between an ON state and an OFF state. 
        When the button is on and it is clicked, it turns off and the text within it changes from 
        ON to OFF and vice versa. Make use of component state for this challenge.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default ButtonInstructions
